Your application will now go to SFPIRG’s Board of Directors for consideration. Please bear with us as this can take a few weeks. We will get back to you with a decision as soon as we can.

If you have any questions about your application, you can speak to our Media & Outreach Coordinator by emailing them at outreach@sfpirg.ca.

In the meantime, any student groups involved in social and environmental justice are welcome to use SFPIRG’s resources. This includes:

	- using our lounge & meeting room for your events and meetings
	- access to supplies like the button maker, megaphone, office supplies, paints & banner paper, coffee maker, etc
	- use of the photocopier for printing your posters and other materials

Just drop in anytime and ask one of our staff members for assistance. We are open Monday to Friday, 10:30am to 4:30pm. We are located in TC326 in the Rotunda, SFU Burnaby.

Warmly,

~ The SFPIRG Team
